# Second Order Ordinary Differential Equations

## Existence and Uniqueness

Given a function $f(x, y, z)$, suppose $f$, $\partial f / \partial y$ and $\partial f / \partial z$ are
continuous functions for $x_1 < x < x_2$, $y_1 < y < y_2$ and $z_1 < z < z_2$.
Then for all initial conditions

$$
y(x_0) = y_0 \quad \text{and} \quad y'(x_0) = z_0
$$

with $x_1 < x_0 < x_2$, $y_1 < y_0 < y_2$ and $z_1 < z_0 < z_2$ there exists a unique solution of

$$
y'' = f(x, y, y')
$$

on some interval $I$ containing $x_0$, i.e. a continuous function with two continuous derivatives satisfying
the the initial conditions and the differential equation.
