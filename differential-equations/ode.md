# Ordinary Differential Equations

## Existence and Uniqueness

Given an initial value problem with

$$
{dy \over dx} = f(x, y) \quad \text{and} \quad y(x_0) = y_0
$$

If $f(x, y)$ and $\partial f / \partial y (x, y)$ are continuous for $a < x < b$ and $c < y < d$
then for any $x_0 \in (a, b)$ and $y_0 \in (c, d)$ the initial value problem has a unique solution on some open interval $I$ containing $x_0$.
