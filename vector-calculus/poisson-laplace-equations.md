# Poisson's Equation and Laplace's Equation
{: .page-title}

With the understanding about how to differentiate and integrate scalar/vector fields in various types,
we can now explore differential equations that can be written in the language of vector calculus.

> *Definition.*{: .def}
> The **Poisson's equation** is of the form
>
> $$
  \nabla^2 \psi(\mathbf{x}) = \rho(\mathbf{x})
  $$
>
> and **Laplace's equation** is a special case of Poisson's equation of the form
>
> $$
  \nabla^2 \psi(\mathbf{x}) = 0
  $$

> *Proposition.*{: .prop}
> Laplace's equation is _linear_, i.e. if $\psi_1$ and $\psi_2$ are solutions,
> then $\lambda \phi_1 + \mu \psi_2$, where $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are real constants, is another solution.

> *Proposition.*{: .prop}
> The solution to the Poisson's equation is the sum of the complementary solution to the Laplace equation and a particular solution for the given source $\rho(\mathbf{x})$.

## Separable Solutions

> *Definition.*{: .def}
> The solution of Laplace's equation is **separable** if it can be written in the form
>
> $$
  \psi(u, v, w) = U(u)V(v)W(w)
  $$

It means that for some functions that is not separable in Cartesian coordinates might be separable in others.
For example,

$$
f(x, y, z) = {1 \over (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^{1 \over 2}} \quad \implies \quad f(r, \theta, \phi) = {1 \over r}
$$

becomes separable in spherical polars.

Using 2D Cartesian coodinates as example, given $\psi = X(x)Y(y)$, substituting it to the Laplace's equation we have

$$
\nabla^2 \psi = X''(x) Y(y) + X(x) Y''(y) = 0
$$

and therefore

$$
{X''(x) \over X(x)} = {Y''(y) \over Y(y)} = C
$$

When $C = 0$, then $X'\'(x) = Y'\'(y) = 0$ so

$$
X = Ax + B \qquad Y = Cy + D
$$

When $C = k^2$, then $X'\' - k^2X = 0$ and $Y'\' + k^2Y = 0$ so

$$
X = Ae^{kx} + Be^{-kx} \qquad Y = C\sin ky + D\cos ky
$$

When $C = -k^2$, then $X'\' + k^2X = 0$ and $Y'\' - k^2Y = 0$ so

$$
X = C\sin kx + D\cos kx \qquad Y = Ae^{ky} + Be^{-ky}
$$

We can see that the solutions to separable Laplace's equations tend to grow or decay smoothly in one direction while oscillating in the other.

## Isotropic Solutions

> *Proposition.*{: .prop}
> The Laplacian oeprator $\nabla^2$ is **isotropic**, meaning it has no preferred direction and unchanged by the rotation of a Cartesian coordinate system.

>
> $$
  \psi(\mathbf{x}) = \psi(r) = A - {B \over r}
  $$

>
> *Proof.*{: .prf}

> For a spherically symmetric solution, we can have $\theta$ and $\phi$ constant in spherical polars and therefore

  \begin{align*}
  \nabla^2 \psi = {1 \over r^2} { d \over dr } \left( r^2 {d\psi \over dr} \right) &= 0 \\
  {d\psi \over dr} &= {B \over r^2} \\
  \psi(r) &= A - {B \over r}
  \end{align*}
  $$

  \begin{align*}
  \int_S \nabla \psi \cdot d\mathbf{S} &= \int_S {d\psi \over dr} (\mathbf{e}_r \cdot \mathbf{e}_r) \,dS \\
  &= \int_S {d \over dr} \left( A - {B \over r} \right) \,dS \\
  &= \int_0^\pi d\theta \int_0^{2\pi} d\phi \left({B \over r^2} \right) (r^2 \sin\theta) \\
  &= 4\pi B
  \end{align*}
  $$

> which is independent of the radius $r$.

It further implies a powerful theorem in physics namely the _Gauss' Law_ which states the flux is indepedent of the shape of the surface and only depends on the source in it.

A dipole can be viewed as being generated by two point sources that are of large but opposite strength and very close to each other.

Similarily results can be derived for the case of radial symmetry.

  \begin{align*}
  \nabla^2 \psi = {1 \over r} {d \over dr} \left( r {d\psi \over dr} \right) &= 0 \\
  {d\psi \over dr} &= {B \over r} \\
  \psi &= A + B \log r
  \end{align*}
  $$

  \begin{align*}

There is a subtle difference that for in general the rotational invariant solution decays to a constant asymptotically
except for the special case $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{R}^2$ in which the solution grows asymptotically as $r \to \infty$.
