# Surfaces
{: .page-title}

> *Definition.*{: .def}
> A **parameterised surface** $S$ is a map of the form $\mathbf{r}: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^3$.

We can also represent a surface by $z = f(x, y)$ or $F(x, y, z) = 0$ and convert them to parametric form by for example, having

$$
\mathbf{r}(u, v) = u \mathbf{i} + v \mathbf{j} + f(u, v) \mathbf{k}
$$

> *Definition.*{: .def}
> A **normal vector** $\mathbf{n}$ of a point on the surface is the vector which points perpendicularly away from the surface.
