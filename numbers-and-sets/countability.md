## Countable Sets

> *Definition.*{: .def}
> A non-empty set $A$ is **finite** if there is a positive integer $n$ and a bijection $f: \set{1,...,n} \to A$.
> Otherwise it is **infinite**. The empty set is by convention taken to be finite.

> Two sets $A$ and $B$ are **equinumerous** if there is a bijection from $A$ to $B$, denoted by $A \sim B$.

An infinite set can be equinumerous with a proper subset of itself,
e.g. $\mathbb{N} \sim 2\mathbb{N}$ with the bijection $f: \mathbb{N} \to 2\mathbb{N}$ given by $f(n) = 2n$.
It is clearly impossible for finite sets so this property is propsed as the definition of infiniteness.

Obviously, a finite set can be counted, and we shall extend the notion of counting to infinite set as follows.

> *Definition.*{: .def}
> A set $A$ is **countable** if either it is finite or it is infinite and $\mathbb{N} \sim A$.

This definition is cumbersome to apply will lead to two results yield more convenient criteria.

> *Definition.*{: .def}
> For sets $A$ and $B$, $A$ is **dominated** by $B$ if there is an injection from $A$ to $B$, denoted by $A \preceq B$.

The above theorem provides a necessary and sufficient condition for countability.
Here are proofs that certain familiar sets are countable.

  h(n) = \begin{cases}

  \end{cases}
  $$

Another useful techinque on constructing the injection is the use of product of primes or powers of primes.
We can also use it to construct surjection by using the fact that factorization of $n$ into product of primes is unique up to order.
The following demonstrates the use of them.

  h(a, b) = 2^{f(a)} \cdot 3^{g(b)}
  $$

## Uncountable Sets

To make countability meaningful, we need to know how to construct uncountable sets.

> *Theorem.*{: .thm}
> For any set $A$, there is no bijection from $A$ to the power set $\mathcal{P}(A)$.
>
> *Proof.*{: .prf}
>
> Suppose $f: A \to \mathcal{P}(A)$ is a bijection, then $f(a)$ is a subset of $A$, in which $a$ itself might or might not in $f(a)$.
>
> Let $T = \set{a \in A : a \not \in f(a)}$.
> $T$ is a subset of $A$ so there exists $b \in A$ such that $f(b) = T$.
> If $b \in T$, then it implies $b \not \in T$ by definition of $T$., contradiction.
> If $b \not \in T$, then it implies $b \in T$ as it satisfies the criteria of being in $T$, contradiction.
>
> Hence, the assumption about the bijection is false and there is no bijection from $A$ to $\mathcal{P}(A)$.

> *Corollary.*{: .cor}
> $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ is not countable.
>
> *Proof.*{: .prf}
>
> $\mathcal{P}(A)$ is infinite but $\mathbb{N} \not \sim \mathcal{P}(A)$ as there is no bijection from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$.

> *Definition.*{: .def}
> A set is **uncountable** if it is infinite and it is not equinumerous with $\mathbb{N}$.

To show that two sets are equinumerous, we need to construct a bijection between them.
However, it is sometimes difficult to do so because it is hard to ensure surjection.
The following theorem provides a useful technique we can use:

> *Theorem.*{: .thm}
> **[SchrÃ¶der-Bernstein Theorem]**
> If $A$ and $B$ are sets and there exist injections $f: A \to B$ and $g: B \to A$ then there exists a bijection between $A$ and $B$, i.e.
>
> $$
  A \preceq B \land B \preceq A \implies A \sim B
  $$

> *Theorem.*{: .thm}
> Let $I$ be any interval in $\mathbb{R}$ which is not empty and not a singleton. Then $I \sim R$.
>
> *Proof.*{: .prf}
>
> An open interval $(a, b)$ is equinumerous with the interval $(-\pi/2, \pi/2)$ via the bijection $f: (\pi/2, \pi/2) \to (a, b)$ defined by
>
> $$
  f(x) = b + {b - a \over \pi} \left( x - {\pi \over 2} \right)
  $$
>
> which is the line from $(-\pi/2, a)$ to $(\pi/2, b)$.
> Then we have $(-\pi/2, \pi/2)$ equinumerous with $\mathbb{R}$ via the tangent function.
> So, $(a, b) \sim \mathbb{R}$.
>
> Any interval $I$ contains a bounded non-empty open interval $J$.
> As $J \sim \mathbb{R}$ and $J \subseteq I$ implies $J \preceq I$, $\mathbb{R} \preceq I$.
> Also, $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ implies $I \preceq \mathbb{R}$.
> Hence, $I \sim \mathbb{R}$.

> *Theorem.*{: .thm}
> $\mathbb{R} \sim \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ and hence $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable.
>
> *Proof.*{: .prf}
>
> Consider the interval $I = [0, 1)$ and $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$.
>
> Given $X \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, we construct a decimal expansion $0.a_0a_1a_2...$ by putting
>
> $$
  a_i = \begin{cases}
  0 & \text{if } i \not \in X \\
  1 & \text{if } i \in X \\
  \end{cases}
  $$
>
> and let $f(X) = 0.a_0a_1a_2...$. Certainly $f: \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N}) \to I$ is an injection and $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N}) \preceq I$.
>

  g(x) = \set{n_k10^k : k \in \mathbb{N}}
  $$
>
> in an injection and $I \preceq \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$.
>
> Hence, $I \sim \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ and $I \sim \mathbb{R}$ implies $\mathbb{R} \sim \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$.
