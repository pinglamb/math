# Special Functions of Analysis
{: .page-title}

Some of the functions play an important role in different fields of sciences which we shall develop their principal properties.
Among them are exponential, logarithmic and trigonometric functions.
Instead of like the brief [discussions](../vectors-and-matrices/exponential-cosine-sine-functions.md) before,
we shall define them as the sums of infinite series and prove their well known properties in a rigorous manner.

## Exponential Function

## Logarithmic Function

## Trigonometric Functions
