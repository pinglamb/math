# Symmetric Groups
{: .page-title}

> *Definition.*{: .def}
> The set of all [permutations](permutations.md) of $X$ is denoted by $\text{Sym} X$ or $\mathbb{P}(X)$.

> *Lemma.*{: .lem}
> $\text{Sym} X$ with _composition_ forms a group.
>
> *Proof.*{: .prf}
>
> 0\. Given $\sigma, \tau \in \text{Sym} X$, $\sigma \circ \tau$ is also a bijection so $\sigma \circ \tau \in \text{Sym}$.
>
> 1\. The permutation $1_X: X \to X$ which fixes all elements is the identity
>
> 2\. Given $\sigma \in \text{Sym} X$, $\sigma^{-1}: X \to X$ is also a bijection and $\sigma^{-1} \circ \sigma = 1_X$ by definition.
>
> 3\. Composition of functions is associative

> *Definition.*{: .def}
> If $X$ is finite, say $\vert X \vert = n$, we usually use $X = \set{1, 2, ..., n}$ and $\text{Sym} X = S_n$.

> *Definition.*{: .def}
> The **degree** of a symmetric group $S_n$ is the number of underlying elements (not permutations), i.e. $\text{deg}\,S_n = n$.

> *Lemma.*{: .lem}
> The **order** of $S_n$, denoted by $\vert S_n \vert$, is $n!$.
>
> *Proof.*{: .prf}
>
> For a permutation $(a_1\;a_2\;...\;a_n) \in S_n$, $a_1$ has $n$ choices, $a_2$ has $n - 1$ choices and so on. Hence, $\vert S_n \vert = n!$.

## Generating Sets

There are a few choices of generating set for $S_n$.

> *Theorem.*{: .thm}
> $S_n$ is generated by transpositions.
>
> *Proof.*{: .prf}
>
> As [every permutation is a product of transpositions](permutations.md#permutation-transpositions), $S_n$ is generated by transpositions.

> *Theorem.*{: .thm}
> The set $\set{(1\;2), (1\;3), ..., (1\;n)}$ generates $S_n$.
>
> *Proof.*{: .prf}
>
> As $(a\;b) = (1\;a)(1\;b)(1\;a)$, the above set generates $S_n$.

> *Theorem.*{: .thm}
> The set $\set{(1\;2), (2\;3), ..., (n-1\;n)}$ generates $S_n$.
>
> *Proof.*{: .prf}
>
> As $(a\;b) = (b-1\;b)(b-2\;b-1)...(a+1\;a+2)(a\;a+1)(a+1\;a+2)...(b-2\;b-1)(b-1\;b)$,
> the above set generates $S_n$.

> *Theorem.*{: .thm}
> The set $\set{(1\;2), (1\;2\;...\;n)}$ (a transposition and a $n$-cycle) generates $S_n$.
>
> *Proof.*{: .prf}
>
> In general,
>
> $$
  (k\;k+1) = (1\;2\;...\;n)^{k-1}(1\;2)(1\;2\;...\;n)^{1-k}
  $$
>
> for $2 \le k < n$ and we can construct the set $\set{(1\;2), (2\;3), ..., (n-1\;n)}$ to generate $S_n$.

## $\text{sgn}$ as homomorphism

> *Theorem.*{: .thm}
> For $n \ge 2$, $\text{sgn}: S_n \to \set{\pm 1}$ is a surjective group homomorphism
>
> *Proof.*{: .prf}
>
> $$
  \text{sgn}(\sigma_1\sigma_2) = (-1)^{k_1 + k_2} = (-1)^{k_1}(-1)^{k_2} = \text{sgn}(\sigma_1)\text{sgn}(\sigma_2)
  $$
>
> It is surjective as we always have $\text{sgn}(e) = 1$ and $\text{sgn}((1\;2)) = -1$.

## Alternating Group

> *Theorem.*{: .thm}
> The even permutations in $S_n$ form a subgroup, which is called the **alternating group** $A_n$.
>
> *Proof.*{: .prf}
>
> Product of even permutation is even. The identity is even. Inverse of even permutation is even.
>
> We also have
>
> $$
  \ker \text{sgn} = A_n
  $$
>
> which [is a subgroup](homomorphisms.md#kernel-is-subgroup).

> *Theorem.*{: .thm}
> The order of $A_n$ is $n!/2$.
>
> *Proof.*{: .prf}
>
> For every even permutation $\sigma \in S_n$, $(1\;2)\sigma$ is odd and distinct.
> We can therefore pair each of them and show that precisely half its elements are even.

> *Theorem.*{: .thm}
> For $n \ge 3$, $A_n$ is generated by 3-cycles.
>
> *Proof.*{: .prf}
>
> Given a permutation $\sigma \in A_n$, it has even number of transpositions.
> For each adjacent pair, there are 2 cases: $(b\;c)(a\;b) = (a\;c\;b)$ and $(c\;d)(a\;b) = (a\;d\;c)(a\;b\;c)$.
> As both of the cases can be expressed as 3-cycles, $A_n$ is generated by them.

## Subgroup of $S_n$

> *Theorem.*{: .thm}
> Any subgroup of $S_n$ contains either no odd permutations, or precisely half.
>
> *Proof.*{: .prf}
>
> Let $G \le S_n$ and $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ be the even elements in $G$.
>
> If there are no odd elements, $G \le A_n$.
>
> If there is an odd element $g \in G$, then the elements $ga_1, ga_2, ga_3, ..., ga_n$ are all odd.
> Also, if $ga_i = ga_j$ for some $i, j$, $g^{-1}(ga_i) = g^{-1}(ga_j)$ and $a_i = a_j$. Thus, they are all distinct.
>
> Hence, $G$ has either no odd elements, or exactly half of them are odd.

$S_n$ can be viewed as subgroup of $S_m$ with $n \le m$, by fixing $n+1, n+2, ..., m$.

$D_{2n}$ can also be viewed as a subgroup of $S_n$ by numbering the vertices of a regular $n$-gon.

Using $D_6$ as example, we can write

$$
S_3 = \set{e, (1\,2\,3) = r, (1\,3\,2) = r^2, (2\,3) = s, (1\,2) = rs, (1\,3) = r^2s }
$$

From the above, we can see $S_3 \cong D_6$.

## Conjugacy in $S_n$
{: #conjugacy-in-symmetric-group}

> *Theorem.*{: .thm}
> Two permutations are conjugate iff they have the same cycle type.
>
> *Proof.*{: .prf}
>
> If $(a_1\,a_2\,...\,a_k)$ is a $k$-cycle and $\rho \in S_n$, then
>
> $$
  \rho(a_1\,a_2\,...\,a_k)\rho^{-1} = (\rho(a_1)\,\rho(a_2)\,...\,\rho(a_k))
  $$
>
> Suppose $\sigma = \sigma_1 \sigma_2 ... \sigma_l$, where $\sigma_i$ are disjoint cycles, then
>
> $$
  \rho\sigma\rho^{-1} = (\rho\sigma_1\rho^{-1})(\rho\sigma_2\rho^{-1})...(\rho\sigma_l\rho^{-1})
  $$
>
> which has the same cycle type as $\sigma$.
>
> Conversely, if $\sigma, \tau \in S_n$ have the same cycle type, then
>
> $$
  \rho = \begin{pmatrix}
  a_1 & a_2 & \cdots & a_n \\
  b_1 & b_2 & \cdots & b_n \\
  \end{pmatrix}
  $$
>
> is the permutation that satisfies $\rho\sigma\rho^{-1} = \tau$.
