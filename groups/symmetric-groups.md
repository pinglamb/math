# Symmetric Groups

## Definition

The set of all [permutations](permutations.md) of $X$ is denoted by $\text{Sym} X$ or $\mathbb{P}(X)$.

$\text{Sym} X$ with composition forms a group.

_[Proof]_

If $X$ is finite, say $\|X\| = n$, we usually write $X = \set{1, 2, ..., n}$ and $\text{Sym} X = S_n$,
and the _degree_ of the symmetric group is $n$.
