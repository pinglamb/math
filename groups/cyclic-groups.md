# Cyclic Groups

## Definition

A group $G$ is _cyclic_ if there is an element $g \in G$ such that all elements of $G$ are powers of $g$.
Such an element is called a _generator_.

$$
G = \set{g^n : n \in \mathbb{Z}}
$$

## Cyclic subgroup

For a group $G$ and $a \in G$, the cyclic subgroup generated by $a$, denoted by $\left<a\right>$,
is defined to be the smallest subgroup containing $a$.
It is in fact the set of all powers of $a$.

_[Proof]_ For the set of all powers of $a$, $a^0 = e$ is a power of $a$, so it is non-empty.
Given $a^m$ and $a^n$, $(a^m)(a^n)^{-1} = a^{m-n}$ is a power of $a$. So, the powers of $a$ is a subgroup of $G$.

If $a$ is in any subgroup, the inverse $a^{-1}$ is in the subgroup, and hence $a^n$ is in the subgroup as well by closure.
As the powers of $a$ is already a subgroup from the above, it is the smallest one containing $a$, i.e. is in fact $\left<a\right>$.

### Additive group R

The additive group $\mathbb{R}$ is not cyclic. A subgroup of $(\mathbb{R}, +)$ is cyclic if and only if it has a smallest positive element $h$, in which is the generator.

_[Proof]_ Let $H$ be a cyclic group, say $H = \set{nh : n \in \mathbb{Z}}$, then $\|h\|$ is the smallest positive element.

If $H$ has a smallest positive element $h$, then by closure, $nh \in H$ for $n \in \mathbb{Z}$.
Suppose there is an element $a = nh + t \in H$, where $0 \le t < h$. As $-nh \in H$, we have $a - nh = t \in H$, but $h$ is the smmalest positive element in $H$ so $t = 0$.
Hence, $H = \set{nh : n \in \mathbb{Z}}$.

## Order of an element

For $a \in G$, $\text{ord}(a) = \|\left<a\right>\|$.

_[Proof]_ If $\text{ord}(a) = \infty$, then $a^n \not= e$ for any $n$ and $a^m \not = a^n$ for all $m \not = n$, hence $\left<a\right>$ has infinite order.

If $\text{ord}(a) = n$, then $\left<a\right> = \set{a^0 = e, a, a^1, ..., a^{n-1}}$, as $a^n = e$, $a^{n+1} = a$, and so on, also $a^{-1} = a^{n-1}$ etc.
So $\|\left<a\right>\| = n$.

## Isomorphism

Any two cyclic groups of the same finite order $n$ are isomorphic, and hence isomorphic to $(\mathbb{Z}_n, +)$.

_[Proof]_

Any two infinite cyclic groups are isomorphic, and hence isomorphic to $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$
