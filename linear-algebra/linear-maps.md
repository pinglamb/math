# Linear Maps
{: .page-title}

In order to compare different mathematical systems of the same type, it is essential to study the functions which preserve the operations of the system.
For vector spaces, linear maps are the functions that preserve the linearity the operations of addition and scalar multiplication.

We will later on see that the $\dim \mathcal{L}(U, V) = \dim U \times \dim V$.

$\mathcal{L}(U, V)$ has one more operation: multiplication of linear maps $\alpha \beta$ which satisfies the associative and distributive laws.
Therefore, $\mathcal{L}(U, V)$ is a _ring_.

## Isomorphism

> *Definition.*{: .def}

  \alpha \beta (\lambda v_1 + \mu v_2) = \mathrm{id}_V(\lambda v_1 + \mu v_2) = \lambda \alpha \beta(v_1) + \mu \alpha \beta(v_2) = \alpha (\lambda \beta(v_1) + \mu \beta(v_2))
  $$
>

It means that linear map is completely determined by its effect on a set of basis vectors.
Conversely, we can define a unique linear map by assigning arbitrary images for a set of basis vectors.

It can be considered as a special case that if the arbitrary vectors appeared to be a basis of $V$ then the corresponding linear map is an isomorphism.

In fact, we can choose to write the coefficients by rows ($m$-by-$n$) or columns ($n$-by-$m$) when we form the matrix.
The reason to have the $i$-th column containing the coefficients of the linear combination of the $i$-th basis vector is that we want to align the result of linear maps composition and matrix multiplication, i.e. $\alpha\beta = (A_{ij})(B_{ij})$.

## Rank and Nullity

  \text{Im}\, \alpha = \Set{\alpha(u) : u \in U}
  $$

  \ker \alpha = \Set{u \in U : \alpha(u) = 0}
  $$

By definition, $\alpha$ is injective iff $\ker \alpha = 0$ and surjective iff $\text{Im}\, \alpha = V$.

> *Proposition.*{: .prop}
> Let $\alpha: U \to V$ be a linear map between vector spaces over $\mathbb{F}$.

  \alpha(\lambda u_1 + \mu u_2) = \lambda \alpha(u_1) + \mu \alpha(u_2) = 0
  $$

  \lambda \alpha(u_1) + \mu \alpha(u_2) = \alpha(\lambda u_1 + \mu u_2) \in \text{Im}\, \alpha
  $$

  $$

>

The rank-nullity theorem is very important and worth of a more direct proof.
This proof relies on the important property that linear map is determined by its effect on the basis vectors and the ability to extend any set of linear independent vectors to a basis.
With that, we can define a basis for the kernel subspace and extend it to a basis for the domain and study how the linear map transform them.
